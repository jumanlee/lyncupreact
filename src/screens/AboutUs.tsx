          Simply press <strong>Join Queue</strong> to get matched into a private
          chatroom with <strong>two or three other remote professionals</strong>
          . LyncUp matches and groups users whom our algorithm predicts are
          likely to enjoy engaging and interacting with each other in a
          chatroom. Before joining the queue to be matched, just ensure that
          your profile is up to date so that other users can see your bio and
          that you can get the most out of your experience.

          How the matching algorithm learns from your past Like interactions
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Every time you Like someone, the algorithm notes your preference
          privately. Over time, it learns from your Like patterns and notes the
          type of users you prefer interacting with. It then compares your Likes
          with those of other users to identify common preferences. In simple
          terms: it learns people's preferences and groups together those who
          are likely to enjoy chatting with each other based on past
          interactions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          This helps ensure future matches become increasingly relevant and
          enjoyable. Yet, at times, the matches are intentionally varied,
          introducing new people and perspectives to keep conversations fresh
          and engaging.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          <strong>The result:</strong> More enjoyable conversations, better
          connections, and no extra effort or intrusive data collection.

          Likes remain anonymous, ensuring a relaxed environment free from
