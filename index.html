      the below prevents app from being indexed by search engines, 
      since the app is still in prototype stage.

      Note: A /public/robots.txt file is also included, which is 
      automatically served at https://your-domain.com/robots.txt since it's in the public directory.
      It doesn't need to be referenced here, crawlers check for it by default.
